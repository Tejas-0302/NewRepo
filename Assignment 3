# Create a Python class called "Student" that has the following attributes: name, age, and grade. Define an initialization method to initialize these attributes when an object of the class is created. Create an instance of the class and set the attributes. Finally, print the attributes of the student object.

# Extend the "Student" class from the previous question. Add a method called "is_passing" that returns True if the student's grade is greater than or equal to 50 and False otherwise. Create an instance of the class and use this method to check if the student is passing. Display the result

#  Create a new class called "HighSchoolStudent" that inherits from the "Student" class. Add an additional attribute called school_name to the "HighSchoolStudent" class. Create an instance of the "HighSchoolStudent" class and set both the attributes, including the inherited attributes from the "Student" class. Print all the attributes of the high school student.

# Create a Python function called "greet" that takes a name as a parameter and a greeting message as an optional parameter with a default value of "Hello". The function should return a formatted greeting message. Test the function by calling it with and without the optional parameter and display the results.
